stands for Red, Green, and Blue, which are the three primary colors of light. The RGB color model works by combining these three primary colors in different ways to create a wide range of colors.</p>\n<p>In the RGB color model, each color is represented by a combination of three numbers between 0 and 255, representing the intensity of the red, green, and blue components respectively. For example, pure red is represented as (255, 0, 0), pure green as (0, 255, 0), and pure blue as (0, 0, 255).</p>\n<p>In Matplotlib, the RGB color values are defined on a scale of 0 to 1 instead of 0 to 255. This means that the red, green, and blue components of a color are represented as a decimal value between 0 and 1 instead of an integer value between 0 and 255.For example, pure red in Matplotlib is represented as (1, 0, 0), pure green as (0, 1, 0), and pure blue as (0, 0, 1). </p>\n<p><img src=\"rgb_colors.png\" alt=\"rgb_colors\"></p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers language-python\"
