I am ==Mei Jiaojiao==, nice to meet you.

Currently I am a master's student majoring in Artificial Intelligence, with fully-founded support of Chinese government scholarships 🇨🇳 and Stipendium Hungaricum scholarship programme 🇭🇺 . Bachelor's studies in Electronic Engineering, with two papers in signal processing, prizes in mathematical modeling competitions, two exchange semester programs, a degree in Chinese Law, eight months experience in patents drafting and analysis. This site is created to record my studying notes.📒 

The website is called wintersweet, the name of a flower that blooms in winter, which is also the English translation of my family name. This flower can bring some beautiful colors to the world at a time everything is withered, and it is not afraid of blowing wind and snow. I hope I can have one tenth of such toughness and courage in my lifetime, and bring some warmth to people around me.❤️
